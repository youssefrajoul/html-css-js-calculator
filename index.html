                    Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                    readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented
                    approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.
                    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including
                    structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
                    described
                    as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library

                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    It
                    is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                    application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                    standard
                    data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                    graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs
                    for
                    I/O.

                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few
                    implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to
                    let
                    programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                    platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically
                    compiled
                    to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
                    architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
                    either
