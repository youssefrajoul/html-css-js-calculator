# Calculator Web App

## Description

This is a simple Calculator web app developed during the first year of my bachelor's degree. It is built using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Performs basic addition operations

## Development Tools

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For app logic and interactivity.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefrajoul/simple-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

3. **Open the application in your browser:**

   - If you are using a live server extension or a local development server, use the following URL:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:your-port-number/index.html
   ```

   - Replace your-port-number with the port your server is running on (e.g., 5500, 3000, etc.).

   - Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in your web browser by navigating to the file location on your computer.
